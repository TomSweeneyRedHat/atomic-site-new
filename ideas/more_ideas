some ideas for the atomic workstation section

* anatomy of the system

  * filesytem: what is readonly, what isn't: /etc, /var, /home
  * packaging: ostree (base image), rpms (layering), flatpaks (desktop apps), containers (anything else)

* first steps: how do I...

  * update my system ?

  To get updates for the OS, you can run: rpm-ostree upgrade.
  Starting with Fedora 28, gnome-software will also offer OS
  updates on Atomic systems. Note that due to the atomic nature
  of the OS, you will have to reboot into the new image to
  have the updates take effect.
 
  * update my applications ?

  To update your flatpak applications, you can run: flatpak update.
  gnome-software will also offer flatpak application updates.
  Note that flatpaks are independent of the base system, so you
  can install updates without a reboot, and just restart affected
  applications afterwards to get the new version.

  * get onto a new OS release ? Do I have to reinstall ?

  No, you don't have to reinstall. You can run: rpm-ostree rebase,
  and give it the name of the new OS (fixme: how to find that name).
  The process is very similar to a system update: the new OS is
  downloaded and installed in the background, and you just boot into
  it when it is ready.

  We plan to have gnome-software offer the same functionality in
  Fedora 28 as well.
