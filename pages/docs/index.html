<h1>Learning More</h1>
<p>Read the <a href='/docs/introduction'>Introduction to Project Atomic</a> for information about the goals and scope of the project.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The<a href="/docs/quickstart">Quick Start Guide</a>.will help you get Atomic up and running quickly.</p>
<p>When Atomic is up and running, read the <a href='/docs/gettingstarted'>Getting Started Guide</a> to learn more about your new Atomic setup.</p>
<p>
For more information about Project Atomic's desktop version, check out our temporary documentation about <a href="/docs/fedora-atomic-workstation">Fedora Atomic Workstation</a>.

<h2>More In-depth Documentation</h2>

<h3>Updating the Atomic Host</h3>
<p>
Atomic hosts are
<a href='/docs/os-updates'>updated</a>
using a tool called rpm-ostree. An easy way to think about
rpm-ostree and its parent project
<a href='https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>OSTree</a>
is "git for operating systems."
</p>
<p>
Using rpm-ostree we can easily update the system in one "atomic"
transaction, and roll back to the prior system if an update has any
issues.
</p>
<h3>Managing Storage</h3>
<p>
To set up additional storage for /var/lib/docker see
<a href='/docs/docker-storage-recommendation'>Setting Up Storage</a>
and when considering alternative filesystems see
<a href="/docs/filesystems">Supported Filesystems</a>.
</p>
<h3>Atomic: /usr/bin/atomic</h3>
<p>
The Atomic
<a href='/docs/usr-bin-atomic'>(/usr/bin/atomic) Documentation</a>
explains how to use the atomic command on Atomic hosts. This command
defines the entrypoint for Project Atomic hosts.
</p>
<p>
The goal of
<a href='https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic/'>/usr/bin/atomic</a>
is to provide a high-level, coherent entrypoint to the system, and fill
in gaps that are not filled by Linux container implementations.
</p>

<h3>Containment and Security</h3>
<p>
Beyond the isolation provided by containers, Atomic relies on
Security-Enhanced Linux to improve the security of the host and
between containers, see
<a href='/docs/docker-and-selinux'>Docker and SELinux</a>
for details of the increased protection available.
</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>
When an application is composed using multiple containers
it can be a bit complex to provide for communication without
losing flexibility. Learn about
<a href='/docs/atomic-host-networking'>Atomic host networking</a>
options for single and multi-host configurations.

How to Contribute to the Documentation
</h2>
<p>
Atomic is a work in progress, and documentation needs to follow the
pace of the developments.
</p>
<p>
To help achieve this, the documentation (as well as the whole
web site) is available from the
<a href='https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-site/'>atomic-site</a>
repository on GitHub as part of the
<a href='https://github.com/projectatomic/'>projectatomic</a>
framework.
Most of the documents are simply written in the
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown'>Markdown</a>
plain text formatting syntax, they are as a result easy to edit and
extend. To change a document, clone the atomic site and make your edits under the
<code>sources/docs/</code>
directory. If you add a new file please also register it in
<code>data/docs.yml</code>
. Then send us a pull request on GitHub or the resulting patch to the
<a href='http://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-devel'>atomic-devel</a>
mailing-list if you prefer. Thanks !
</p>
<p>
The web site itself is available in the
<a href='https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-site/'>atomic-site</a>
repository on GitHub, it is built using
<a href='http://middlemanapp.com/'>Middleman</a>
framework, see the
<code>README.md</code>
at the top of the git checkout for informations. It also uses
<a href='http://haml.info/'>Haml</a>
for more complex formatting of some pages, check the
<a href='http://haml.info/tutorial.html'>Tutorial</a>
to get started editing some of the haml pages.

<h1>Introduction to Project Atomic</h1>

<p>Project Atomic is an umbrella for several projects related to re-designing the operating system around principles of immutable infrastructure, using the LDK (Linux, Docker, Kubernetes) stack.  </p>

<p>Many of the components of Project Atomic are upstream components of <a href="https://www.openshift.org/">OpenShift Origin v3</a>.</p>

<p>The primary building block of Project Atomic is the <q>Atomic Host</q>, a lightweight
container OS which implements these ideas. Atomic Hosts are immutable, since
each is imaged from an upstream repository, supporting mass deployment.
Applications run in containers. Atomic Host versions based on
CentOS and Fedora are available, and there is also a downstream enterprise
version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>

<p>Currently, the host comes out of the box with
<a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> installed.  A goal however is to
move to a containerized Kubernetes installation, to more easily
support different versions on the same host, such as
<a href="https://www.openshift.org/">OpenShift v3</a>.  The Atomic Host also
comes with several Kubernetes utilites such as
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/flannel">flannel</a>.  Kubernetes currently uses
<a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>, an open source
project for creating lightweight, portable, self-sufficient
application containers.</p>

<p>The host system is managed via
<a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/os-updates/">rpm-ostree</a>, an open
source tool for managing bootable, immutable, versioned filesystem
trees from upstream RPM content. This and several other components are wrapped
in the <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic">atomic</a> command which provides
a unified entrypoint.  </p>

<p>The Project Atomic umbrella also encompasses other tools which are essential
to immutable, container-based infrastructures, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cockpit-project.org/">Cockpit</a> gives visibility into your hosts
and your container cluster.</li>
<li>Many patches and extensions to Docker for better SELinux and systemd integration.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle">Atomic Developer Bundle</a>
to make development of containerized applications easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more tools and projects available within
<a href="https://github.com/projectatomic">Project Atomic</a>. We&rsquo;re building the
next-generation operating system, one component at a time.</p>

<h2>How Can Project Atomic Help Me?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The traditional enterprise OS model with a single runtime environment controlled by the OS and shared by all applications does not meet the requirements of modern application-centric IT.</li>
<li>The complexity of the software stack, the amount of different stacks, and the speed of change have overwhelmed the ability of a single monolithic stack to deliver in a consistent way.</li>
<li>Developer/DevOps-led shops seek control over the runtime underneath their applications, without necessarily owning the entire stack.</li>
<li>VMs provide a means for separation among applications, but this model adds significant resource and management overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slimming down the host with the Atomic distribution limits the surface area and patch frequency for administrators.  Docker containers offer developers and admins a clear path to delivering consistent and fully tested stacks from development to production.  Containers secured with Linux namespaces, cGroups, and SELinux give isolation close to that of a VM, with much greater flexibility and efficiency.  And simple, easy-to-use tools like Cockpit provide cross-cluster capabilities to deploy and manage applications.</p>
