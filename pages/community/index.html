<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>The Atomic project aims to build a welcoming and diverse community
around the various components needed to compose, deploy and manage
Atomic hosts and applications inside.</p>
<p>
The Atomic project relies on several open source
projects as the building blocks used for the project. For the hosts
it relies heavily on <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux kernel</a>
features, the
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a>
system and service manager,
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/OSTree">OSTree</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree">rpm-ostree</a>
for updates,
<a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a>,
and <a href="http://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a>
for application deployment,
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/openshift/origin">OpenShift</a>
for orchestration, and of course our two primary Linux distributions,
<a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> and <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a>.
The Atomic community works toward development of the Atomic project
in an inclusive way by contributing to the related upstream projects,
solving integration issues in the various distributions being used and
developing the specific management tools needed for management and
system updates.

<h2>Discussions and Meetings</h2>
<p>
The main project mailing list is the
<a href="http://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-devel">"atomic-devel list"</a>,
which hosts both development and usage discussions.  There's also a low traffic list for
<a href="http://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-announce">announcements</a>.
(Please note that the atomic@projectatomic.io mailing list has no traffic, and is
reserved for future use.)
</p>
<p>
For chat, we use the Freenode IRC servers in the
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#atomic">#atomic</a>
channel.
</p>
<p>
The general Atomic community meeting is every two weeks at 16:00 UTC on
Mondays on channel <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/atomic">#atomic</a>.
Please check the <a href="http://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-devel">atomic-devel list</a>
for meeting announcements and agendas.
</p>
<p>
Several Project Atomic's member projects have public meetings, which you are also encouraged
to attend.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fedora Atomic Host and FLIBS: every Wednesday at 16:30 UTC in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/fedora-meeting-1">#fedora-meeting-1</a>.</li>

<h2>Report Issues</h2>
<p>
Before reporting issues, please check in chat or on the mailing list that
you've found a new issue.  You can also search
<a href="https://serverfault.com/search?q=atomic+host">Server Fault</a>
for responses to other users with the same issue.
</p>
<p>
As Project Atomic covers multiple sub-projects and distributions, where
to report issues depends on which distribution or component you're reporting
and issue against.  In general, it's useful to check on chat or the
mailing list where to report things.  Here are links to a few of the issue trackers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>CentOS Atomic Host and Red Hat Atomic Host: first <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?product=Atomic">check existing issues</a>, then <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Atomic">enter a new bug</a>. We appreciate your bugs!</li>
<li><a href="https://pagure.io/atomic-wg/issues">Fedora Atomic Host and FLIBS issues</a> on Pagure.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues">Cockpit Issues</a> on GitHub.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o/issues">CRI-O Issues</a> on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other projects use their issue trackers in their individual git repos, under
the <a href="https://github.com/projectatomc">Project Atomic organization</a>.
