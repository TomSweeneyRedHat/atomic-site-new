<p>This week was the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Cloud_WG_2016">Fedora Cloud Working Group&rsquo;s Activity <q>Day</q></a> (FAD), where a dozen of us got together to work on the project&rsquo;s adoption and innovation in the public and private cloud sectors. Discussions and decisions there covered a range of topics, including Fedora Atomic Host, public cloud images, Vagrant improvements, and automated testing of cloud base images, Atomic and container images. You&rsquo;ll be seeing a bunch of changes resulting from this over the coming months.</p>

<p>One topic came up which is going to pretty much eat my time for at least a week, though: we don&rsquo;t yet have a working, easy-to-deploy download of <a href="https://github.com/openshift/origin">OpenShift Origin</a> on Fedora Atomic Host.  Clearly, we need to fix this; my goal is to have something working by this time next week, for <a href="http://dockercon.com/">DockerCon</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>During the Hackathon period of the FAD, Adam Miller, Jason Brooks and I set to work on making Fedora Atomic Origin happen.  We quickly found that there were four major areas of work to be to get things up and running:</p>

<ol>
<li>Packaging and testing using containerized <a href="https://github.com/fedora-cloud/openshift-ansible/">Openshift-Ansible</a> for configuring new clusters;</li>
<li>Replacing the container base images for the OpenShift container components with Fedora base images;</li>
<li>Recreating some components which currently pull from RHEL RPM and container repositories;</li>
<li>Polishing and testing deploying <a href="https://github.com/fedora-cloud/openshift-ansible/blob/master/README_CONTAINERIZED_INSTALLATION.md">fully containerized OpenShift</a> on Fedora Atomic Host.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the Hackathon, while Adam worked on item 2, Jason and I worked on Openshift-Ansible. One of the first issues we ran across was that Openshift-Ansible requires an older version of Ansible that isn&rsquo;t available on current Fedora (an update is in progress).  Jason created <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jasonbrooks/ansible1.9.4/">a new COPR</a> to allow installing a compatible version into a Fedora Container.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I looked at running Openshift-Ansible in a container.  This is not currently the primary deployment method; today, OpenShift administrators generally run Ansible from a non-Atomic Host, installed as packages and source.  A containerized version, though, allows an Atomic OpenShift cluster to be self-bootstrapping, something we clearly want.  Thankfully, the OpenShift team has already done the lion&rsquo;s share of the work required for containerizing it, and <a href="https://github.com/fedora-cloud/openshift-ansible/blob/master/Dockerfile">example Dockerfiles are available on github</a>.</p>

<p>Like I said, though, this approach isn&rsquo;t well-used, and hasn&rsquo;t been tested at all on Fedora, just CentOS.  So my first task is revising the container definition, then testing and troubleshooting.  There&rsquo;s a fair amount of work to do there; by the end of the hackathon, I didn&rsquo;t yet have it working.</p>

<p>Once I have containerized Ansible working, my next task will be to design a way to run it in a <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/09/using-a-spc-to-troubleshoot-containers/">super-privileged container</a> (SPC).  The reason we need to do that is that, among other things, Openshift-Ansible configures Docker and its networking overlay.  For self-bootstrapping, we need it to be able to configure Docker on the same host where Ansible is running, which means <em>not</em> running it under Docker.  Besides, given the broad permissions Ansible needs, an SPC is appropriate. We&rsquo;ll also want to convert some of the other standard OpenShift containers to SPCs, maybe all of them.</p>

<p>So, I guess I know what I&rsquo;m doing for the next week.  Feel like helping out?  Our <a href="https://github.com/fedora-cloud/openshift-ansible/">fork of OpenShift-Ansible is here</a>.</p>
