<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Brno/events/225508213/">Docker Brno Meetup</a> group will have its next meeting on 15 October 2015 at 6 pm at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Cyrilsk%C3%A1+7%2C+Brno%2C+cz">Impact Hub</a> in Brno, Czech Republic.  Four talks are planned for the meeting to address a wide range of docker users and people interested in learning more.  The community element will be enhanced by visitors from the  Docker Bratislava, Docker Prague and Docker Krakow Meetup groups.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/vpavlin">Václav Pavlín</a> from Red Hat will present, <q>Nulecule - how to define, distribute and deploy multi-container applications.</q>  There is no standard mechanism for creating, distributing and deploying multi-container applications.  The Nulecule specification solves this problem by allowing the definition, metadata, dependencies and orchestration provider configurations to be packaged up into a single usable unit.  This talk will also cover Atomic App, the reference implementation of Nulecule.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cz.linkedin.com/in/matteoferraroni">Matteo Ferraroni</a> from Digital-blue will present, <q>Ceph and Docker: How to get persistent storage on the cloud.</q>  Docker promises that you can <q>Build, Ship, and Run Any App, Anywhere,</q> but what happens when you need an enterprise-grade multiple host environment to run your production applications?  Digital-blue discovered that the storage solutions provided out-of-the-box by Docker has some gaps. This led to them seeking a way to provide reliable persistent storage to their containers running in a multi-host environment.  Ultimately the solution was found with CEPH.  This talk will explain the gaps in the Docker storage subsystem and how CEPH can be used to provide persistent storage.  There will also be a hands-on lab where the audience can try out the solution.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cz.linkedin.com/in/yurytsarev">Yury Tsarev</a> from GoodData will present, <q>Using docker together with test kitchen and serverspec for puppet test automation.</q>  Learn how to win at <q>buzzword bingo</q> by combining two popular testing tools with docker to create a <q>test-driven infrastructure.</q></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cz.linkedin.com/in/tnozicka/en">Tomáš Nožička</a> from Seznam.cz will present, <q>Using docker for advanced testing, building packages for multiple distributions and altogether.</q> This two-part presentation will start with a demonstration of using docker for unit testing when a database, such as MySQL, is required.  In the second part code will be tested and built in a clean environment for multiple distributions using docker.  In this second part we will explore using <q>docker in docker</q> and <q>docker next to docker</q> as part of the solution.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I look forward to seeing you there and to interacting with you and other community members.  Show up with questions and excitement.</p>
