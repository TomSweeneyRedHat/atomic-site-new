<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on the Project Atomic team at Red Hat on Security for Docker containers. In order to get the word out I have been writing a series of blogs on Docker Security for OpenSource.com. I&rsquo;ve written two so far, and hope to have the third done soon.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux">first post</a> covers the fact that a privileged process within a container is the same from a security point of view as the security of a privileged process outside of a container.  The idea I am trying to get across is to set up your application services the same way inside of containers as out, and <strong>don&rsquo;t rely on container technology to protect you</strong>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://opensource.com/business/14/9/security-for-docker">second post</a> covers everything that has been put into Docker to try to control the privileged and unprivileged processes within a container. We have things like Read Only File Systems, Dropped capabilities, SELinux, Control over device nodes <em>etc.</em> The cool part of this is it adds a lots of nice new security over the containerized service, but (see <q>Are Docker containers really secure?</q>), you still want to only use trusted applications and drop privileges as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The last post on OpenSource.com will cover the next group of features we want to add to Docker to make it more secure.</p>

<p>After publishing the first two articles SDTimes contacted me to do an interview on Docker Security, which they published <a href="http://sdtimes.com/red-hat-open-source-community-fortifying-docker/">today as <q>How Red Hat and the open-source community are fortifying Docker</q></a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the presentation I gave at DockerCon discussing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWGFqMuEHdw">Docker and SELinux</a> is available on YouTube. Continue watching here for additional Docker security information!</p>
