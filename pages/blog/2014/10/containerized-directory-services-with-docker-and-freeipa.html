<p>I&rsquo;ve tried out a lot of different software applications in my time, so I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate projects and products that make it easy to get up and running quickly and without the need for assembling a whole labful of equipment.</p>

<p>In this vein, the various components that comprise <a href="http://www.ovirt.org/Home">oVirt</a>, the open source virtualization management project, can be piled onto a single piece of hardware in form that works well enough to credibly kick the project&rsquo;s tires. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Well, mostly. In order to really get your oVirt on, you need to hook up a directory service of some sort. FreeIPA is an obvious choice to provide oVirt with directory services, but due to conflicts between their package sets, oVirt&rsquo;s management engine can&rsquo;t be installed on the same host as FreeIPA.</p>

<p>Sounds like a job for Docker, right? Just in time for the approaching release of <a href="http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_3.5_Release_Notes">oVirt 3.5</a>, the good people behind the CentOS Dockerfiles repository (the same one I mentioned in a <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2014/09/exploring-web-apps-with-docker/">recent post</a> about trying out WordPress 4.0) have recently added a <a href="https://github.com/CentOS/CentOS-Dockerfiles/tree/master/freeipa/centos7">FreeIPA Dockerfile</a> to the list of containerized components on offer.</p>

<p>I set out to deploy a dockerized FreeIPA instance on the same machine as the oVirt management engine, to see whether the combination would work well enough for testing oVirt&rsquo;s multiuser capabilities.</p>

<p>I started off with a machine running a minimal install of CentOS 6.5, to which I added the EPEL repository (for Docker) and the oVirt 3.5 RC4 repository:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>sudo yum install -y http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm epel-release&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Next, I added git, Docker, and the oVirt Engine:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>sudo yum install -y git docker-io ovirt-engine&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Then, I set up oVirt Engine, by running the command <code>engine-setup</code> and accepting all the defaults suggested by the install script.</p>

<p>With the engine up and running, I started up the Docker service, grabbed the source of the FreeIPA Dockerfile, and kicked off a build of the image:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>sudo service docker start&#x000A;git clone https://github.com/CentOS/CentOS-Dockerfiles.git&#x000A;cd CentOS-Dockerfiles/freeipa/centos7/&#x000A;sudo docker build -t freeipa-server .&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Next, as described in the <a href="https://github.com/CentOS/CentOS-Dockerfiles/blob/master/freeipa/centos7/README">README</a>, I ran the container image:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>docker run --privileged --name freeipa-server-container -ti -h ipa.example.test -e PASSWORD=Secret123 freeipa-server&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>The FreeIPA image is set up to configure itself on first run, a process that takes a couple of minutes. When the setup was complete, I found myself at a bash prompt within the new container (couresy of the optional <code>-ti</code> in the run command).  From this shell, I had to make a small configuration tweak to <a href="http://www.ovirt.org/Troubleshooting#Adding_an_IPA_domain_to_ovirt_engine">deal with an issue</a> between FreeIPA and oVirt Engine.</p>

<p>I needed to modify the file <code>/etc/dirsrv/slapd-EXAMPLE-TEST/dse.ldif</code> and change the line <code>nsslapd-minssf: 0</code> to <code>nsslapd-minssf: 1</code> before stopping and restarting the container. </p>

<p>From the shell within the container, I could stop the container by typing <code>exit</code>, and, once returned to the promt on my test machine, restart the container with the command <code>docker start -ai freeipa-server-container</code>.</p>

<p>Once I was back at the shell within my FreeIPA container, I created a new user to use with oVirt:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kinit admin</code> <em>to authenticate as the FreeIPA admin, using the <code>Secret123</code> password from the run command</em></li>
<li><code>ipa user-add</code> <em>to create my user account, I chose the user name <code>ouser</code></em></li>
<li><code>ipa passwd ouser</code> <em>to set an initial password for the new user</em></li>
<li><code>kinit ouser</code> <em>to authenticate as ouser, and change its password, as required by FreeIPA</em></li>
</ul>

<p>After that, I ran <code>ip a</code> from the container shell to figure out the container&rsquo;s IP address. With that address in hand, I visited a separate terminal window, outside of the container, and I edited the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file in my test machine to include the line <code>namesever CONTAINER-IP-HERE</code> so that my machine would use the new containerized FreeIPA for DNS.</p>

<p>Finally, I was ready to hook my containerized FreeIPA to oVirt&rsquo;s management engine, using the account <code>admin</code> and the <code>Secret123</code> password referenced above, before adding superuser privileges to the <code>ouser</code> account and restarting ovirt-engine for the new setup to take effect:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>engine-manage-domains add --domain=example.test --user=admin --provider=ipa&#x000A;engine-manage-domains edit --add-permissions --domain=example.test --user=ouser&#x000A;service ovirt-engine restart&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>And there we have it, a containerized copy of FreeIPA to ride alongside the oVirt management engine, RPM conflicts be damned:</p>

<p>After playing with this long enough to get it working, I do think that this is a decent option for testing oVirt&rsquo;s various user permission-tied features in a lab setting, but it could use some smoothing-out before I could see using it more broadly. In particular, the way I used the container&rsquo;s internal IP address for the host machine DNS is brittle, since that IP changes at every boot. </p>

<p>Also, since oVirt Engine and FreeIPA each expect to use port 443 for their web interfaces, I had to stick to accessing FreeIPA through the command line. </p>

<p>If the engine also ran within a container, I could use Docker&rsquo;s linking functionality to deal with these changing IPs. Soon, I think I&rsquo;ll try to pick up on the <a href="http://allthingsopen.com/2013/12/19/building-docker-images-on-fedora/">experiments others have begun</a> w/ oVirt Engine and Docker, and delve into running the hypervisor portion of the oVirt stack within a container as well, building on this recent howto on <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2014/10/libvirtd_in_containers/">running libvirtd within a container</a>.</p>
